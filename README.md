# How to install BepInEx (5 mono) guide [https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html]

TLDR:
1. Download the correct version of BepInEx (bepinex 5 mono) [https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx]
2. Extract the contents into the game root (where [NuclearOption.exe] lives)
3. Start the game once to generate configuration files.
4. Open [Nuclear Option\BepInEx\config\BepInEx.cfg] and make sure that the setting [Chainloader]
 -> HideGameManagerObject = true.
5. (optional) also edit [Logging.Console]-> Enabled = true.

(you can also change bepinex settings ingame using the Mod Configuration manager)


## How to install mods for BepInEx?
- For your first mod download this mod: [Mod Configuration manager][https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager]
- This is an awesome plugin that gives you an ingame mod menu to control mods (i try to add support for it in my mods) [TOGGLE WITH F1]

  ![ModMenuDemo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ee561c4-f2ac-4798-9896-a3dc8bca9714)
  
- in the downloaded zip file there is a BepInEx folder, you can drop it right in the install folder.
- Some other mods might be just .dll files, drop those in [Nuclear Option\BepInEx\plugins\ (optional folder)]
