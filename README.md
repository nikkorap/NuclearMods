how to install mods for BepInEx?
- For your first mod download this mod: [Mod Configuration manager]
   [https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager/releases/download/v18.4/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager_BepInEx5_v18.4.zip]
   This is an awesome plugin that gives you an ingame mod menu to control mods (i try to add support for it in my mods) [TOGGLE WITH F1]
- in the downloaded zip file there is a BepInEx folder, you can drop it right in the install folder.
- Some other mods might be just .dll files, drop those in the [Nuclear Option\BepInEx\plugins\(optional folder)] folder

## My Mods
# Don't even try these in public lobbies, if i find out i'm going to [redacted]. it won't work anyway if the host doesn't have it activated.

## DetailedClimbRate
Is seaskimming too ambigious? then grab this mod to turn 0m/s into 0.00m/s (or feet if you're into that)

## 155mm_Railgun
replaces the Ifrit's 27mm Autocannon with the Dynamos 155mm Railgun, also adds it to every hardpoint.

## RubberBullets
Targets dying too quick? want to prank your teammates with fake missiles? want to unscrew the detonator from your bombs and see if you can get someone with pure kinetic energy? then this mod is for you!

## UnrestrictedWeapons
Want more guns? More Bombs? whatever you want, you can have it, if your airframe can handle it. 

## RandomLoadouts_client
Want to be more ùì°ùì™ùì∑ùì≠ùì∏ùì∂? public matches too repetitive? Then let the dice choose your next loadout! (should work with unrestricted weapons too if the server supports it)

## RandomLoadouts_Host
Hosting a game and want to add some excitement to your players? Make it unfair for everyone equally and force everyone to roll the dice every time they step into the cockpit! (afaik others can be completely modless peasants! though mods are still recommended) (should work with unrestricted weapons too)

## namegrabber
not intended for gameplay, i made this to help missionmakers. it creates a .txt file with unit's internal names and ingame names, like this: ([Aircraft][AttackHelo1][SAH-46 Chicane][The SAH-46 Chicane retains a traditional attack helicopter configuation while incorporating upgrades that keep it a formidable presence on the battlefield of the late 21st Century. Cutting edge stealth technology allows the Chicane to conduct pop-up attacks from behind terrain and disappear from radar without a trace.])
