## Limited lives

Dont want players in your server going on suicide runs? then grab this!
this mod heavily encourages returning to base safely.

If a player crashes or is killed, then they are restricted to only fly the Chicane or the Tarantula, and with a restricted loadout (default only the turrets for some self defense).
Restricted players can get their wings back if they successfully rescue and return a friendly pilot.
Features configurable messages when a player gets restricted or unrestricted.
