## Race Timer
Want to see exactly how fast or slow you are? then take this mod to see the exact splits, down to the milliseconds. This mod is fully reliant on mission messages, the first message sent is used as the start, each message after that is used as a checkpoint. this mod creates a .txt file next to the .dll, which contains your best times in each mission.
